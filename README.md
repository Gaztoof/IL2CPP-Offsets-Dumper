# IL2CPP-Offsets-Dumper

I coded this in around 10 minutes, but recently had some free time so I recoded it.
Code should still be pretty spaghetti but atleast it's better than before.

Use IL2CPP Dumper (https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) and once you have a dummy GameAssembly.dll, use this to get a .hpp file with every offsets for the target game.

Feel free to do what-ever you want with it.
