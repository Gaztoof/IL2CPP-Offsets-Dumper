I AM AWARE OF THE EXTREME SPAGHETTI-NESS

I will eventually update the whole project, to make it cleaner or better.
For now, it's a single extremely spaghetti looking Program.cs, because when I made it I didn't really plan on sharing it or anyone else than me needing it.
So I coded it as fast as i could (around 10 minutes), it is full of bad coded stuff, and quite dirty over-all, but I'll eventually fix that(one day...).

Feel free to do what-ever you want with it.
